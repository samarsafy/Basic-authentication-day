#Buildung a basic authentication React App

##Introduction
####this is a basic authentication React App, where the user have to login then he will be linked to the admin page, if the password is right. otherwise the user will be tracked to the login page again.

##Idea

####the idea was to build a Basic React App without actually do this through the terminal, so without doing

$ create react app

##install

#### so i cloned the pachage.json (version: 1.0.0), and webpack.config.js from another reprository. the files used here are for example cloned from my reprository "suberblog". i installed also react-dom in the terminal.

$npm install react react-dom

####the Basic-authentication-day App is being renderd in terminal through the command
$ npm run client

#### the App had three components, Home.js, Admin.js and Login.js. i deleted them and rendered them in App.jsx through the Route. so the user get directed to admin page, when his id is true. or redirected to login again if his id is false

#i saw this video for the building of the app
